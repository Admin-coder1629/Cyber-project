      <h2>What is Cyberbullying?</h2>
      <p>Cyberbullying is the use of digital technology to repeatedly harm, threaten, or embarrass someone. It includes sending mean messages, sharing embarrassing photos without permission, spreading rumors online, or excluding someone from online groups. Unlike traditional bullying, cyberbullying can happen 24/7 and can reach a much larger audience, making it particularly harmful and difficult to escape.</p>
