      <h2>What is a Digital Footprint?</h2>
      <p>A digital footprint is the trail of information you leave behind when you use the internet. Every time you visit a website, post on social media, send an email, or download an app, you create digital traces. Think of it like footprints in sand - they show where you've been and what you've done.</p>

      <h2>Real-Life Examples</h2>
      <div class="example-box">
        <h3>Example 1: Social Media Posts</h3>
        <p>When Sarah posts a photo of her vacation on Instagram with location tags, she creates a digital footprint showing where she was and when. This information stays online even if she deletes the post later.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="example-box">
        <h3>Example 2: Online Shopping</h3>
        <p>When Alex buys a video game online, the website stores his purchase history, payment information, and browsing habits. This data can be used to show him similar products in the future.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="example-box">
        <h3>Example 3: Search History</h3>
        <p>Every time Maya searches for homework help on Google, her search terms are recorded. This helps Google show her relevant results but also creates a record of her interests.</p>
