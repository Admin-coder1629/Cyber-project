      <h2>What is Hacking?</h2>
      <p>Hacking is the act of gaining unauthorized access to computer systems, networks, or accounts. While some hackers use their skills for good purposes (called "white hat" hackers), malicious hackers (called "black hat" hackers) break into systems to steal information, cause damage, or commit crimes. Hackers use various techniques to bypass security measures and access private data or systems they shouldn't have access to.</p>
