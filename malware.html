      <h2>What is Malware?</h2>
      <p>Malware is short for "malicious software." It's any software designed to harm, disrupt, or gain unauthorized access to your computer or device. Malware includes viruses, worms, trojans, spyware, and other harmful programs. Think of malware as digital germs that can make your computer "sick" and cause serious problems with your files and personal information.</p>
