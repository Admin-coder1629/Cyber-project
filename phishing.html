      <h2>What is Phishing?</h2>
      <p>Phishing is a type of cyber attack where criminals pretend to be trustworthy organizations to steal your personal information. They send fake emails, text messages, or create fake websites that look real to trick you into giving them your passwords, credit card numbers, or other sensitive information. The word "phishing" sounds like "fishing" because criminals are trying to "catch" your information with fake "bait."</p>

      <h2>Real-Life Examples</h2>
      <div class="example-box">
        <h3>Example 1: Fake Bank Email</h3>
        <p>Tom receives an email that looks like it's from his bank saying his account will be closed unless he clicks a link and enters his password. The email looks real with the bank's logo, but it's actually from criminals trying to steal his login information.</p>

        <h3>Example 2: Fake Social Media Message</h3>
        <p>Lisa gets a message saying her Instagram account has been hacked and she needs to click a link to secure it. The link takes her to a fake Instagram page where she enters her username and password, which the criminals then steal.</p>
