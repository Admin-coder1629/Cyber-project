      <h2>What is Ransomware?</h2>
      <p>Ransomware is a type of malicious software that locks or encrypts your files and demands payment (ransom) to unlock them. It's like a digital kidnapper that holds your important files hostage until you pay money. Criminals use ransomware to make money by threatening to permanently delete your photos, documents, and other important data unless you pay them, usually in cryptocurrency like Bitcoin.</p>

      <h2>Real-Life Examples</h2>
      <div class="example-box">
        <h3>Example 1: School Computer Attack</h3>
        <p>A high school's computer system was infected with ransomware that locked all student records, grades, and administrative files. The criminals demanded $50,000 to unlock the files. The school had to close for several days and lost years of important data because they didn't have proper backups.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="example-box">
        <h3>Example 2: Family Computer Infection</h3>
        <p>The Johnson family's computer was infected when their daughter clicked on a fake software update. All their family photos, videos, and documents were encrypted. The ransomware displayed a message demanding $500 to get their files back, but even after paying, they never received the decryption key.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="example-box">
        <h3>Example 3: Hospital System Attack</h3>
        <p>A major hospital's computer systems were hit by ransomware, locking access to patient records and medical equipment. Doctors had to use paper records and some surgeries were delayed. This shows how ransomware can be life-threatening in critical situations.</p>

      <h2>Dangers of Ransomware</h2>
      <p>Ransomware attacks can be extremely dangerous because they can:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Lock you out of all your important files and photos</li>
        <li>Demand large amounts of money with no guarantee of getting files back</li>
        <li>Spread to other computers on the same network</li>
        <li>Cause permanent loss of irreplaceable memories and documents</li>
        <li>Disrupt businesses, schools, and even hospitals</li>
        <li>Lead to identity theft if personal information is stolen</li>
        <li>Cause emotional stress and financial hardship</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

        <li>Keep your operating system and software updated with security patches</li>
        <li>Use reliable antivirus software with real-time protection</li>
        <li>Don't click on suspicious email attachments or links</li>
        <li>Avoid downloading software from untrusted websites</li>
        <li>Use strong passwords and enable two-factor authentication</li>
        <li>Disconnect from the internet immediately if you suspect an infection</li>
        <li>Never pay the ransom - there's no guarantee you'll get your files back</li>
        <li>Educate family members about safe internet practices</li>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Ransomware is one of the most dangerous cyber threats because it can cause permanent loss of important data and financial harm. The best defense is prevention through regular backups, updated security software, and careful online behavior. Remember: paying the ransom doesn't guarantee you'll get your files back and only encourages criminals to continue their attacks.</p>
