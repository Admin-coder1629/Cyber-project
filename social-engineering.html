      <h2>What is Social Engineering?</h2>
      <p>Social engineering is a method used by cybercriminals to manipulate people into revealing confidential information or performing actions that compromise security. Instead of using technical hacking methods, social engineers exploit human psychology, emotions, and trust to trick people. They often pretend to be someone trustworthy or create urgent situations to pressure people into making quick decisions without thinking carefully.</p>

      <h2>Real-Life Examples</h2>
      <div class="example-box">
        <h3>Example 1: Fake Tech Support Call</h3>
        <p>Mrs. Smith receives a phone call from someone claiming to be from Microsoft, saying her computer has a virus. The caller sounds professional and asks her to download software to "fix" the problem. In reality, the software gives the criminal access to her computer and personal files.</p>

      <div class="example-box">
        <h3>Example 2: Pretexting Attack</h3>
        <p>A criminal calls Alex pretending to be from his bank, saying there's suspicious activity on his account. They already know some of his personal information (gathered from social media) to sound legitimate. They ask for his account number and PIN to "verify his identity," which they then use to steal his money.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="example-box">
        <h3>Example 3: Fake Emergency</h3>
        <p>Emma receives a message on social media from someone claiming to be her cousin, saying they're stranded in another country and need money urgently. The message creates panic and urgency, causing Emma to send money before realizing it's a scam and her cousin's account was hacked.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Social engineering is particularly dangerous because it targets human emotions and trust rather than technical vulnerabilities. The best defense is awareness and skepticism. Always verify requests for personal information through official channels, take time to think before acting on urgent requests, and remember that it's okay to say no or ask questions. When in doubt, consult with a trusted adult before sharing any personal information.</p>
