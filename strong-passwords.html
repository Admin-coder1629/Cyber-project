      <h2>What are Strong Passwords?</h2>
      <p>A strong password is a combination of letters, numbers, and symbols that is difficult for others to guess or crack. It's your first line of defense against hackers and cybercriminals. Think of your password as the key to your digital house - you want it to be unique and complex enough that only you can use it. Strong passwords protect your personal information, accounts, and digital identity from unauthorized access.</p>

      <h2>Real-Life Examples</h2>
      <div class="example-box">
        <h3>Example 1: Weak Password Consequences</h3>
        <p>Sarah used "password123" for her email account. Hackers easily guessed it and gained access to her email, where they found her bank account information and social media passwords. They were able to steal money and post embarrassing content on her social media accounts.</p>

      <div class="example-box">
        <h3>Example 2: Strong Password Success</h3>
        <p>Mike created the password "Tr@il$2024!Hike" for his gaming account. When hackers tried to break into gaming accounts, Mike's account remained safe because his password was too complex to crack. He continued playing without any security issues.</p>

      <div class="example-box">
        <h3>Example 3: Password Reuse Problem</h3>
        <p>Jenny used the same password "jenny2010" for all her accounts. When one website was hacked and her password was stolen, criminals were able to access her email, social media, and online shopping accounts, causing problems across all her online activities.</p>
